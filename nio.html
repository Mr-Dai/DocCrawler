<h1 id="java-nio-tutorial"><a name="user-content-java-nio-tutorial" href="#java-nio-tutorial" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Tutorial</h1>
<p>Java NIO (New IO) is an alternative IO API for Java (from Java 1.4), meaning alternative to the standard <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/index.html">Java IO</a> and <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-networking/index.html">Java Networking</a> API&rsquo;s. Java NIO offers a different way of working with IO than the standard IO API&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2 id="java-nio-channels-and-buffers"><a name="user-content-java-nio-channels-and-buffers" href="#java-nio-channels-and-buffers" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO: Channels and Buffers</h2>
<p>In the standard IO API you work with byte streams and character streams. In NIO you work with channels and buffers. Data is always read from a channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel.</p>
<h2 id="java-nio-non-blocking-io"><a name="user-content-java-nio-non-blocking-io" href="#java-nio-non-blocking-io" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO: Non-blocking IO</h2>
<p>Java NIO enables you to do non-blocking IO. For instance, a thread can ask a channel to read data into a buffer. While the channel reads data into the buffer, the thread can do something else. Once data is read into the buffer, the thread can then continue processing it. The same is true for writing data to channels.</p>
<h2 id="java-nio-selectors"><a name="user-content-java-nio-selectors" href="#java-nio-selectors" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO: Selectors</h2>
<p>Java NIO contains the concept of &ldquo;selectors&rdquo;. A selector is an object that can monitor multiple channels for events (like: connection opened, data arrived etc.). Thus, a single thread can monitor multiple channels for data.</p>
<p>How all this works is explained in more detail in the next text in this series - the Java NIO overview.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-overview"><a name="user-content-java-nio-overview" href="#java-nio-overview" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Overview</h1>
<p>Java NIO consist of the following core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Channels</li>
<li>Buffers</li>
<li>Selectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Java NIO has more classes and components than these, but the <code>Channel</code>, <code>Buffer</code> and <code>Selector</code> forms the core of the API, in my opinion. The rest of the components, like <code>Pipe</code> and <code>FileLock</code> are merely utility classes to be used in conjunction with the three core components. Therefore, I&rsquo;ll focus on these three components in this NIO overview. The other components are explained in their own texts elsewhere in this tutorial. See the menu at the top corner of this page.</p>
<h2 id="channels-and-buffers"><a name="user-content-channels-and-buffers" href="#channels-and-buffers" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Channels and Buffers</h2>
<p>Typically, all IO in NIO starts with a <code>Channel</code>. A <code>Channel</code> is a bit like a stream. From the <code>Channel</code> data can be read into a <code>Buffer</code>. Data can also be written from a <code>Buffer</code> into a <code>Channel</code>. Here is an illustration of that:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Channels and Buffers" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/overview-channels-buffers.png" title="" /></p>
<p>There are several <code>Channel</code> and <code>Buffer</code> types. Here is a list of the primary <code>Channel</code> implementations in Java NIO:</p>
<ul>
<li>FileChannel</li>
<li>DatagramChannel</li>
<li>SocketChannel</li>
<li>ServerSocketChannel</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, these channels cover UDP + TCP network IO, and file IO.</p>
<p>There are a few interesting interfaces accompanying these classes too, but I&rsquo;ll keep them out of this Java NIO overview for simplicity&rsquo;s sake. They&rsquo;ll be explained where relevant, in other texts of this Java NIO tutorial.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the core <code>Buffer</code> implementations in Java NIO:</p>
<ul>
<li>ByteBuffer</li>
<li>CharBuffer</li>
<li>DoubleBuffer</li>
<li>FloatBuffer</li>
<li>IntBuffer</li>
<li>LongBuffer</li>
<li>ShortBuffer</li>
</ul>
<p>These <code>Buffer</code>&lsquo;s cover the basic data types that you can send via IO: byte, short, int, long, float, double and characters.</p>
<p>Java NIO also has a <code>MappedByteBuffer</code> which is used in conjunction with memory mapped files. I&rsquo;ll leave this <code>Buffer</code> out of this overview though.</p>
<h2 id="selectors"><a name="user-content-selectors" href="#selectors" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Selectors</h2>
<p>A <code>Selector</code> allows a single thread to handle multiple <code>Channel</code>&lsquo;s. This is handy if your application has many connections (Channels) open, but only has low traffic on each connection. For instance, in a chat server.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of a thread using a <code>Selector</code> to handle 3 <code>Channel</code>&lsquo;s:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Selectors" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/overview-selectors.png" title="" /></p>
<p>To use a <code>Selector</code> you register the <code>Channel</code>&lsquo;s with it. Then you call it&rsquo;s <code>select()</code> method. This method will block until there is an event ready for one of the registered channels. Once the method returns, the thread can then process these events. Examples of events are incoming connection, data received etc.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-channel"><a name="user-content-java-nio-channel" href="#java-nio-channel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Channel</h1>
<p>Java NIO Channels are similar to streams with a few differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can both read and write to a Channels. Streams are typically one-way (read or write).</li>
<li>Channels can be read and written asynchronously.</li>
<li>Channels always read to, or write from, a Buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, you read data from a channel into a buffer, and write data from a buffer into a channel. Here is an illustration of that:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Channels and Buffers" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/overview-channels-buffers.png" title="" /></p>
<h2 id="channel-implementations"><a name="user-content-channel-implementations" href="#channel-implementations" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Channel Implementations</h2>
<p>Here are the most important Channel implementations in Java NIO:</p>
<ul>
<li>FileChannel</li>
<li>DatagramChannel</li>
<li>SocketChannel</li>
<li>ServerSocketChannel</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>FileChannel</code> reads data from and to files.</p>
<p>The <code>DatagramChannel</code> can read and write data over the network via UDP.</p>
<p>The <code>SocketChannel</code> can read and write data over the network via TCP.</p>
<p>The <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> allows you to listen for incoming TCP connections, like a web server does. For each incoming connection a <code>SocketChannel</code> is created.</p>
<h2 id="basic-channel-example"><a name="user-content-basic-channel-example" href="#basic-channel-example" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Basic Channel Example</h2>
<p>Here is a basic example that uses a <code>FileChannel</code> to read some data into a <code>Buffer</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">RandomAccessFile aFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;data/nio-data.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
    FileChannel inChannel = aFile.getChannel();

    ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

    int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
    while (bytesRead != -1) {

      System.out.println(&quot;Read &quot; + bytesRead);
      buf.flip();

      while(buf.hasRemaining()){
          System.out.print((char) buf.get());
      }

      buf.clear();
      bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
    }
    aFile.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>buf.flip()</code> call. First you read into a Buffer. Then you flip it. Then you read out of it. I&rsquo;ll get into more detail about that in the next text about <code>Buffer</code>&lsquo;s.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-buffer"><a name="user-content-java-nio-buffer" href="#java-nio-buffer" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Buffer</h1>
<p>Java NIO Buffers are used when interacting with NIO Channels. As you know, data is read from channels into buffers, and written from buffers into channels.</p>
<p>A buffer is essentially a block of memory into which you can write data, which you can then later read again. This memory block is wrapped in a NIO Buffer object, which provides a set of methods that makes it easier to work with the memory block.</p>
<h2 id="basic-buffer-usage"><a name="user-content-basic-buffer-usage" href="#basic-buffer-usage" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Basic Buffer Usage</h2>
<p>Using a <code>Buffer</code> to read and write data typically follows this little 4-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write data into the Buffer</li>
<li>Call <code>buffer.flip()</code></li>
<li>Read data out of the Buffer</li>
<li>Call <code>buffer.clear()</code> or <code>buffer.compact()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When you write data into a buffer, the buffer keeps track of how much data you have written. Once you need to read the data, you need to switch the buffer from writing mode into reading mode using the <code>flip()</code> method call. In reading mode the buffer lets you read all the data written into the buffer.</p>
<p>Once you have read all the data, you need to clear the buffer, to make it ready for writing again. You can do this in two ways: By calling <code>clear()</code> or by calling <code>compact()</code>. The <code>clear()</code> method clears the whole buffer. The <code>compact()</code> method only clears the data which you have already read. Any unread data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, and data will now be written into the buffer after the unread data.</p>
<p>Here is a simple <code>Buffer</code> usage example, with the write, flip, read and clear operations maked in bold:</p>
<pre><code class="java">RandomAccessFile aFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;data/nio-data.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel inChannel = aFile.getChannel();

//create buffer with capacity of 48 bytes
ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf); //read into buffer.
while (bytesRead != -1) {

  buf.flip();  //make buffer ready for read

  while(buf.hasRemaining()){
      System.out.print((char) buf.get()); // read 1 byte at a time
  }

  buf.clear(); //make buffer ready for writing
  bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
}

<p>A buffer is essentially a block of memory into which you can write data, which you can then later read again. This memory block is wrapped in a NIO Buffer object, which provides a set of methods that makes it easier to work with the memory block.</p>
<p>A <code>Buffer</code> has three properties you need to be familiar with, in order to understand how a <code>Buffer</code> works. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>capacity</li>
<li>position</li>
<li>limit</li>
</ul>
<p>The meaning of <code>position</code> and <code>limit</code> depends on whether the <code>Buffer</code> is in read or write mode. Capacity always means the same, no matter the buffer mode.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of capacity, position and limit in write and read modes. The explanation follows in the sections after the illustration.</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Buffer capacity, position and limit in write and read mode." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/buffers-modes.png" title="" /></p>
<h3 id="capacity"><a name="user-content-capacity" href="#capacity" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Capacity</h3>
<p>Being a memory block, a <code>Buffer</code> has a certain fixed size, also called its &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;. You can only write <code>capacity</code> bytes, longs, chars etc. into the Buffer. Once the Buffer is full, you need to empty it (read the data, or clear it) before you can write more data into it.</p>
<h3 id="position"><a name="user-content-position" href="#position" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Position</h3>
<p>When you write data into the <code>Buffer</code>, you do so at a certain position. Initially the position is 0. When a byte, long etc. has been written into the <code>Buffer</code> the position is advanced to point to the next cell in the buffer to insert data into. Position can maximally become <code>capacity - 1</code>.</p>
<p>When you read data from a <code>Buffer</code> you also do so from a given position. When you flip a <code>Buffer</code> from writing mode to reading mode, the position is reset back to 0. As you read data from the <code>Buffer</code> you do so from <code>position</code>, and <code>position</code> is advanced to next position to read.</p>
<h3 id="limit"><a name="user-content-limit" href="#limit" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Limit</h3>
<p>In write mode the limit of a <code>Buffer</code> is the limit of how much data you can write into the buffer. In write mode the limit is equal to the capacity of the <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<p>When flipping the <code>Buffer</code> into read mode, limit means the limit of how much data you can read from the data. Therefore, when flipping a <code>Buffer</code> into read mode, limit is set to write position of the write mode. In other words, you can read as many bytes as were written (limit is set to the number of bytes written, which is marked by position).</p>
<h2 id="buffer-types"><a name="user-content-buffer-types" href="#buffer-types" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Buffer Types</h2>
<p>Java NIO comes with the following <strong>Buffer</strong> types:</p>
<ul>
<li>ByteBuffer</li>
<li>MappedByteBuffer</li>
<li>CharBuffer</li>
<li>DoubleBuffer</li>
<li>FloatBuffer</li>
<li>IntBuffer</li>
<li>LongBuffer</li>
<li>ShortBuffer</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, these <code>Buffer</code> types represent different data types. In other words, they let you work with the bytes in the buffer as char, short, int, long, float or double instead.</p>
<p>The <code>MappedByteBuffer</code> is a bit special, and will be covered in its own text.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-a-buffer"><a name="user-content-allocating-a-buffer" href="#allocating-a-buffer" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Allocating a Buffer</h2>
<p>To obtain a <code>Buffer</code> object you must first allocate it. Every <code>Buffer</code> class has an <code>allocate()</code> method that does this. Here is an example showing the allocation of a <code>ByteBuffer</code>, with a capacity of 48 bytes:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example allocating a <code>CharBuffer</code> with space for 1024 characters:</p>
<pre><code class="java">CharBuffer buf = CharBuffer.allocate(1024);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="writing-data-to-a-buffer"><a name="user-content-writing-data-to-a-buffer" href="#writing-data-to-a-buffer" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Data to a Buffer</h2>
<p>You can write data into a <code>Buffer</code> in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write data from a <code>Channel</code> into a <code>Buffer</code></li>
<li>Write data into the <code>Buffer</code> yourself, via the buffer&rsquo;s <code>put()</code> methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example showing how a <code>Channel</code> can write data into a <code>Buffer</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf); //read into buffer.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example that writes data into a <code>Buffer</code> via the <code>put()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="java">buf.put(127);
</code></pre>

<p>There are many other versions of the <code>put()</code> method, allowing you to write data into the <code>Buffer</code> in many different ways. For instance, writing at specific positions, or writing an array of bytes into the buffer. See the JavaDoc for the concrete buffer implementation for more details.</p>
<h2 id="flip"><a name="user-content-flip" href="#flip" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>flip()</h2>
<p>The <code>flip()</code> method switches a <code>Buffer</code> from writing mode to reading mode. Calling <code>flip()</code> sets the <code>position</code> back to 0, and sets the <code>limit</code> to where position just was.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>position</code> now marks the reading position, and <code>limit</code> marks how many bytes, chars etc. were written into the buffer - the limit of how many bytes, chars etc. that can be read.</p>
<h2 id="reading-data-from-a-buffer"><a name="user-content-reading-data-from-a-buffer" href="#reading-data-from-a-buffer" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Data from a Buffer</h2>
<p>There are two ways you can read data from a <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Read data from the buffer into a channel.</li>
<li>Read data from the buffer yourself, using one of the get() methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of how you can read data from a buffer into a channel:</p>
<pre><code class="java">//read from buffer into channel.
int bytesWritten = inChannel.write(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example that reads data from a <code>Buffer</code> using the get() method:</p>
<pre><code class="java">byte aByte = buf.get();
</code></pre>

<p>There are many other versions of the <code>get()</code> method, allowing you to read data from the <code>Buffer</code> in many different ways. For instance, reading at specific positions, or reading an array of bytes from the buffer. See the JavaDoc for the concrete buffer implementation for more details.</p>
<h2 id="rewind"><a name="user-content-rewind" href="#rewind" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>rewind()</h2>
<p>The <code>Buffer.rewind()</code> sets the <code>position</code> back to 0, so you can reread all the data in the buffer. The <code>limit</code> remains untouched, thus still marking how many elements (bytes, chars etc.) that can be read from the <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h2 id="clear-and-compact"><a name="user-content-clear-and-compact" href="#clear-and-compact" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>clear() and compact()</h2>
<p>Once you are done reading data out of the <code>Buffer</code> you have to make the <code>Buffer</code> ready for writing again. You can do so either by calling <code>clear()</code> or by calling <code>compact()</code>.</p>
<p>If you call <code>clear()</code> the <code>position</code> is set back to 0 and the <code>limit</code> to <code>capacity</code>. In other words, the <code>Buffer</code> is cleared. The data in the <code>Buffer</code> is not cleared. Only the markers telling where you can write data into the <code>Buffer</code> are.</p>
<p>If there is any unread data in the <code>Buffer</code> when you call <code>clear()</code> that data will be &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo;, meaning you no longer have any markers telling what data has been read, and what has not been read.</p>
<p>If there is still unread data in the <code>Buffer</code>, and you want to read it later, but you need to do some writing first, call <code>compact()</code> instead of <code>clear()</code>.</p>
<p><code>compact()</code> copies all unread data to the beginning of the <code>Buffer</code>. Then it sets <code>position</code> to right after the last unread element. The <code>limit</code> property is still set to <code>capacity</code>, just like <code>clear()</code> does. Now the <code>Buffer</code> is ready for writing, but you will not overwrite the unread data.</p>
<h2 id="mark-and-reset"><a name="user-content-mark-and-reset" href="#mark-and-reset" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>mark() and reset()</h2>
<p>You can mark a given position in a <code>Buffer</code> by calling the <code>Buffer.mark()</code> method. You can then later reset the position back to the marked position by calling the <code>Buffer.reset()</code> method. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">buffer.mark();

//call buffer.get() a couple of times, e.g. during parsing.

buffer.reset();  //set position back to mark.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="equals-and-compareto"><a name="user-content-equals-and-compareto" href="#equals-and-compareto" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>equals() and compareTo()</h2>
<p>It is possible to compare two buffers using <code>equals()</code> and <code>compareTo()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="equals"><a name="user-content-equals" href="#equals" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>equals()</h3>
<p>Two buffers are equal if:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are of the same type (byte, char, int etc.)</li>
<li>They have the same amount of remaining bytes, chars etc. in the buffer.</li>
<li>All remaining bytes, chars etc. are equal.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, equals only compares part of the <code>Buffer</code>, not every single element inside it. In fact, it just compares the remaining elements in the <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<h3 id="compareto"><a name="user-content-compareto" href="#compareto" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>compareTo()</h3>
<p>The <code>compareTo()</code> method compares the remaining elements (bytes, chars etc.) of the two buffers, for use in e.g. sorting routines. A buffer is considered &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; than another buffer if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first element which is equal to the corresponding element in the other buffer, is smaller than that in the other buffer.</li>
<li>All elements are equal, but the first buffer runs out of elements before the second buffer does (it has fewer elements).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="java-nio-scatter-gather"><a name="user-content-java-nio-scatter-gather" href="#java-nio-scatter-gather" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Scatter / Gather</h1>
<p>Java NIO comes with built-in scatter / gather support. Scatter / gather are concepts used in reading from, and writing to channels.</p>
<p>A scattering read from a channel is a read operation that reads data into more than one buffer. Thus, the channel &ldquo;scatters&rdquo; the data from the channel into multiple buffers.</p>
<p>A gathering write to a channel is a write operation that writes data from more than one buffer into a single channel. Thus, the channel &ldquo;gathers&rdquo; the data from multiple buffers into one channel.</p>
<p>Scatter / gather can be really useful in situations where you need to work with various parts of the transmitted data separately. For instance, if a message consists of a header and a body, you might keep the header and body in separate buffers. Doing so may make it easier for you to work with header and body separately.</p>
<h2 id="scattering-reads"><a name="user-content-scattering-reads" href="#scattering-reads" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Scattering Reads</h2>
<p>A &ldquo;scattering read&rdquo; reads data from a single channel into multiple buffers. Here is an illustration of that principle:</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the <code>Scatter</code> principle:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Scattering Read" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/scatter.png" title="" /></p>
<p>Here is a code example that shows how to perform a scattering read:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer header = ByteBuffer.allocate(128);
ByteBuffer body   = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

ByteBuffer[] bufferArray = { header, body };

channel.read(bufferArray);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the buffers are first inserted into an array, then the array passed as parameter to the <code>channel.read()</code> method. The <code>read()</code> method then writes data from the channel in the sequence the buffers occur in the array. Once a buffer is full, the channel moves on to fill the next buffer.</p>
<p>The fact that scattering reads fill up one buffer before moving on to the next, means that it is not suited for dynamically sized message parts. In other words, if you have a header and a body, and the header is fixed size (e.g. 128 bytes), then a scattering read works fine.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-writes"><a name="user-content-gathering-writes" href="#gathering-writes" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Gathering Writes</h2>
<p>A &ldquo;gathering write&rdquo; writes data from multiple buffers into a single channel. Here is an illustration of that principle:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Gathering Write" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/gather.png" title="" /></p>
<p>Here is a code example that shows how to perform a gathering write:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer header = ByteBuffer.allocate(128);
ByteBuffer body   = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

//write data into buffers

ByteBuffer[] bufferArray = { header, body };

channel.write(bufferArray);
</code></pre>

<p>The array of buffers are passed into the <code>write()</code> method, which writes the content of the buffers in the sequence they are encountered in the array. Only the data between position and limit of the buffers is written. Thus, if a buffer has a capacity of 128 bytes, but only contains 58 bytes, only 58 bytes are written from that buffer to the channel. Thus, a gathering write works fine with dynamically sized message parts, in contrast to scattering reads.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-channel-to-channel-transfers"><a name="user-content-java-nio-channel-to-channel-transfers" href="#java-nio-channel-to-channel-transfers" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Channel to Channel Transfers</h1>
<p>In Java NIO you can transfer data directly from one channel to another, if one of the channels is a <code>FileChannel</code>. The <code>FileChannel</code> class has a <code>transferTo()</code> and a <code>transferFrom()</code> method which does this for you.</p>
<h2 id="transferfrom"><a name="user-content-transferfrom" href="#transferfrom" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>transferFrom()</h2>
<p>The <code>FileChannel.transferFrom()</code> method transfers data from a source channel into the <code>FileChannel</code>. Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">RandomAccessFile fromFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;fromFile.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel      fromChannel = fromFile.getChannel();

RandomAccessFile toFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;toFile.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel      toChannel = toFile.getChannel();

long position = 0;
long count    = fromChannel.size();

toChannel.transferFrom(fromChannel, position, count);
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters position and count, tell where in the destination file to start writing (<code>position</code>), and how many bytes to transfer maximally (<code>count</code>). If the source channel has fewer than <code>count</code> bytes, less is transfered.</p>
<p>Additionally, some <code>SocketChannel</code> implementations may transfer only the data the <code>SocketChannel</code> has ready in its internal buffer here and now - even if the <code>SocketChannel</code> may later have more data available. Thus, it may not transfer the entire data requested (<code>count</code>) from the <code>SocketChannel</code> into <code>FileChannel</code>.</p>
<h2 id="transferto"><a name="user-content-transferto" href="#transferto" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>transferTo()</h2>
<p>The <code>transferTo()</code> method transfer from a <code>FileChannel</code> into some other channel. Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">RandomAccessFile fromFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;fromFile.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel      fromChannel = fromFile.getChannel();

RandomAccessFile toFile = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;toFile.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel      toChannel = toFile.getChannel();

long position = 0;
long count    = fromChannel.size();

fromChannel.transferTo(position, count, toChannel);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how similar the example is to the previous. The only real difference is the which <code>FileChannel</code> object the method is called on. The rest is the same.</p>
<p>The issue with <code>SocketChannel</code> is also present with the <code>transferTo()</code> method. The <code>SocketChannel</code> implementation may only transfer bytes from the <code>FileChannel</code> until the send buffer is full, and then stop.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-selector"><a name="user-content-java-nio-selector" href="#java-nio-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Selector</h1>
<p>A <code>Selector</code> is a Java NIO component which can examine one or more NIO Channel&rsquo;s, and determine which channels are ready for e.g. reading or writing. This way a single thread can manage multiple channels, and thus multiple network connections.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-a-selector"><a name="user-content-why-use-a-selector" href="#why-use-a-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Why Use a Selector?</h2>
<p>The advantage of using just a single thread to handle multiple channels is that you need less threads to handle the channels. Actually, you can use just one thread to handle all of your channels. Switching between threads is expensive for an operating system, and each thread takes up some resources (memory) in the operating system too. Therefore, the less threads you use, the better.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though, that modern operating systems and CPU&rsquo;s become better and better at multitasking, so the overheads of multithreading becomes smaller over time. In fact, if a CPU has multiple cores, you might be wasting CPU power by <strong>not</strong> multitasking. Anyways, that design discussion belongs in a different text. It suffices to say here, that you can handle multiple channels with a single thread, using a <code>Selector</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of a thread using a <code>Selector</code> to handle 3 <code>Channel</code>&lsquo;s:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Selectors" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/overview-selectors.png" title="" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-selector"><a name="user-content-creating-a-selector" href="#creating-a-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating a Selector</h2>
<p>You create a <code>Selector</code> by calling the <code>Selector.open()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Selector selector = Selector.open();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="registering-channels-with-the-selector"><a name="user-content-registering-channels-with-the-selector" href="#registering-channels-with-the-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Registering Channels with the Selector</h2>
<p>In order to use a <code>Channel</code> with a <code>Selector</code> you must register the <code>Channel</code> with the <code>Selector</code>. This is done using the <code>SelectableChannel.register()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">channel.configureBlocking(false);

SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Channel</code> must be in non-blocking mode to be used with a <code>Selector</code>. This means that you cannot use <code>FileChannel</code>&lsquo;s with a <code>Selector</code> since <code>FileChannel</code>&lsquo;s cannot be switched into non-blocking mode. Socket channels will work fine though.</p>
<p>Notice the second parameter of the <code>register()</code> method. This is an &ldquo;interest set&rdquo;, meaning what events you are interested in listening for in the <code>Channel</code>, via the <code>Selector</code>. There are four different events you can listen for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect</li>
<li>Accept</li>
<li>Read</li>
<li>Write</li>
</ol>
<p>A channel that &ldquo;fires an event&rdquo; is also said to be &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for that event. So, a channel that has connected successfully to another server is &ldquo;connect ready&rdquo;. A server socket channel which accepts an incoming connection is &ldquo;accept&rdquo; ready. A channel that has data ready to be read is &ldquo;read&rdquo; ready. A channel that is ready for you to write data to it, is &ldquo;write&rdquo; ready.</p>
<p>These four events are represented by the four <code>SelectionKey</code> constants:</p>
<ol>
<li>SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT</li>
<li>SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT</li>
<li>SelectionKey.OP_READ</li>
<li>SelectionKey.OP_WRITE</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are interested in more than one event, OR the constants together, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">int interestSet = SelectionKey.OP_READ | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE;
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ll return to the interest set a bit further down in this text.</p>
<h2 id="selectionkeys"><a name="user-content-selectionkeys" href="#selectionkeys" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>SelectionKey&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>As you saw in the previous section, when you register a <code>Channel</code> with a <code>Selector</code> the <code>register()</code> method returns a <code>SelectionKey</code> objects. This <code>SelectionKey</code> object contains a few interesting properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interest set</li>
<li>The ready set</li>
<li>The Channel</li>
<li>The Selector</li>
<li>An attached object (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll describe these properties below.</p>
<h3 id="interest-set"><a name="user-content-interest-set" href="#interest-set" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Interest Set</h3>
<p>The interest set is the set of events you are interested in &ldquo;selecting&rdquo;, as described in the section &ldquo;Registering Channels with the Selector&rdquo;. You can read and write that interest set via the <code>SelectionKey</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">int interestSet = selectionKey.interestOps();

boolean isInterestedInAccept  = interestSet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT;
boolean isInterestedInConnect = interestSet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT;
boolean isInterestedInRead    = interestSet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_READ;
boolean isInterestedInWrite   = interestSet &amp; SelectionKey.OP_WRITE;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, you can AND the interest set with the given <code>SelectionKey</code> constant to find out if a certain event is in the interest set.</p>
<h3 id="ready-set"><a name="user-content-ready-set" href="#ready-set" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Ready Set</h3>
<p>The ready set is the set of operations the channel is ready for. You will primarily be accessing the ready set after a selection. Selection is explained in a later section. You access the ready set like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">int readySet = selectionKey.readyOps();
</code></pre>

<p>You can test in the same way as with the interest set, what events / operations the channel is ready for. But, you can also use these four methods instead, which all reaturn a boolean:</p>
<pre><code class="java">selectionKey.isAcceptable();
selectionKey.isConnectable();
selectionKey.isReadable();
selectionKey.isWritable();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="channel-selector"><a name="user-content-channel-selector" href="#channel-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Channel + Selector</h3>
<p>Accessing the channel + selector from the <code>SelectionKey</code> is trivial. Here is how it&rsquo;s done:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Channel  channel  = selectionKey.channel();

Selector selector = selectionKey.selector();
</code></pre>

<h3 id="attaching-objects"><a name="user-content-attaching-objects" href="#attaching-objects" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Attaching Objects</h3>
<p>You can attach an object to a <code>SelectionKey</code> this is a handy way of recognizing a given channel, or attaching further information to the channel. For instance, you may attach the <code>Buffer</code> you are using with the channel, or an object containing more aggregate data. Here is how you attach objects:</p>
<pre><code class="java">selectionKey.attach(theObject);

Object attachedObj = selectionKey.attachment();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also attach an object already while registering the <code>Channel</code> with the <code>Selector</code>, in the <code>register()</code> method. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ, theObject);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="selecting-channels-via-a-selector"><a name="user-content-selecting-channels-via-a-selector" href="#selecting-channels-via-a-selector" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Selecting Channels via a Selector</h2>
<p>Once you have register one or more channels with a <code>Selector</code> you can call one of the <code>select()</code> methods. These methods return the channels that are &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for the events you are interested in (connect, accept, read or write). In other words, if you are interested in channels that are ready for reading, you will receive the channels that are ready for reading from the <code>select()</code> methods.</p>
<p>Here are the <code>select()</code> methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>int select()</li>
<li>int select(long timeout)</li>
<li>int selectNow()</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>select()</strong> blocks until at least one channel is ready for the events you registered for.</p>
<p><strong>select(long timeout)</strong> does the same as <code>select()</code> except it blocks for a maximum of <code>timeout</code> milliseconds (the parameter).</p>
<p><strong>selectNow()</strong> doesn&rsquo;t block at all. It returns immediately with whatever channels are ready.</p>
<p>The <code>int</code> returned by the <code>select()</code> methods tells how many channels are ready. That is, how many channels that became ready since last time you called <code>select()</code>. If you call <code>select()</code> and it returns 1 because one channel has become ready, and you call <code>select()</code> one more time, and one more channel has become ready, it will return 1 again. If you have done nothing with the first channel that was ready, you now have 2 ready channels, but only one channel had become ready between each <code>select()</code> call.</p>
<h3 id="selectedkeys"><a name="user-content-selectedkeys" href="#selectedkeys" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>selectedKeys()</h3>
<p>Once you have called one of the <code>select()</code> methods and its return value has indicated that one or more channels are ready, you can access the ready channels via the &ldquo;selected key set&rdquo;, by calling the selectors <code>selectedKeys()</code> method. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Set&lt;SelectionKey&gt; selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();
</code></pre>

<p>When you register a channel with a <code>Selector</code> the <code>Channel.register()</code> method returns a <code>SelectionKey</code> object. This key represents that channels registration with that selector. It is these keys you can access via the <code>selectedKeySet()</code> method. From the <code>SelectionKey</code>.</p>
<p>You can iterate this selected key set to access the ready channels. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Set&lt;SelectionKey&gt; selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();

Iterator&lt;SelectionKey&gt; keyIterator = selectedKeys.iterator();

while(keyIterator.hasNext()) {

    SelectionKey key = keyIterator.next();

    if(key.isAcceptable()) {
        // a connection was accepted by a ServerSocketChannel.

    } else if (key.isConnectable()) {
        // a connection was established with a remote server.

    } else if (key.isReadable()) {
        // a channel is ready for reading

    } else if (key.isWritable()) {
        // a channel is ready for writing
    }

    keyIterator.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This loop iterates the keys in the selected key set. For each key it tests the key to determine what the channel referenced by the key is ready for.</p>
<p>Notice the <code>keyIterator.remove()</code> call at the end of each iteration. The <code>Selector</code> does not remove the <code>SelectionKey</code> instances from the selected key set itself. You have to do this, when you are done processing the channel. The next time the channel becomes &ldquo;ready&rdquo; the <code>Selector</code> will add it to the selected key set again.</p>
<p>The channel returned by the <code>SelectionKey.channel()</code> method should be cast to the channel you need to work with, e.g a ServerSocketChannel or SocketChannel etc.</p>
<h2 id="wakeup"><a name="user-content-wakeup" href="#wakeup" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>wakeUp()</h2>
<p>A thread that has called the <code>select()</code> method which is blocked, can be made to leave the <code>select()</code> method, even if no channels are yet ready. This is done by having a different thread call the <code>Selector.wakeup()</code> method on the <code>Selector</code> which the first thread has called <code>select()</code> on. The thread waiting inside <code>select()</code> will then return immediately.</p>
<p>If a different thread calls <code>wakeup()</code> and no thread is currently blocked inside <code>select()</code>, the next thread that calls <code>select()</code> will &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; immediately.</p>
<h2 id="close"><a name="user-content-close" href="#close" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>close()</h2>
<p>When you are finished with the <code>Selector</code> you call its <code>close()</code> method. This closes the <code>Selector</code> and invalidates all <code>SelectionKey</code> instances registered with this <code>Selector</code>. The channels themselves are not closed.</p>
<h2 id="full-selector-example"><a name="user-content-full-selector-example" href="#full-selector-example" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Full Selector Example</h2>
<p>Here is a full example which opens a <code>Selector</code>, registers a channel with it (the channel instantiation is left out), and keeps monitoring the <code>Selector</code> for &ldquo;readiness&rdquo; of the four events (accept, connect, read, write).</p>
<pre><code class="java">Selector selector = Selector.open();

channel.configureBlocking(false);

SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);


while(true) {

  int readyChannels = selector.select();

  if(readyChannels == 0) continue;


  Set&lt;SelectionKey&gt; selectedKeys = selector.selectedKeys();

  Iterator&lt;SelectionKey&gt; keyIterator = selectedKeys.iterator();

  while(keyIterator.hasNext()) {

    SelectionKey key = keyIterator.next();

    if(key.isAcceptable()) {
        // a connection was accepted by a ServerSocketChannel.

    } else if (key.isConnectable()) {
        // a connection was established with a remote server.

    } else if (key.isReadable()) {
        // a channel is ready for reading

<p>A Java NIO FileChannel is a channel that is connected to a file. Using a file channel you can read data from a file, and write data to a file. The Java NIO FileChannel class is NIO&rsquo;s an alternative to <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/file.html">reading files with the standard Java IO API</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>FileChannel</code> cannot be set into non-blocking mode. It always runs in blocking mode.</p>
<h2 id="opening-a-filechannel"><a name="user-content-opening-a-filechannel" href="#opening-a-filechannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Opening a FileChannel</h2>
<p>Before you can use a <code>FileChannel</code> you must open it. You cannot open a FileChannel directly. You need to obtain a FileChannel via an InputStream, OutputStream, or a RandomAccessFile. Here is how you open a FileChannel via a RandomAccessFile:</p>
<pre><code class="java">RandomAccessFile aFile     = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;data/nio-data.txt&quot;, &quot;rw&quot;);
FileChannel      inChannel = aFile.getChannel();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="reading-data-from-a-filechannel"><a name="user-content-reading-data-from-a-filechannel" href="#reading-data-from-a-filechannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Data from a FileChannel</h2>
<p>To read data from a <code>FileChannel</code> you call one of the <code>read()</code> methods. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>First a <code>Buffer</code> is allocated. The data read from the <code>FileChannel</code> is read into the <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<p>Second the <code>FileChannel.read()</code> method is called. This method reads data from the <code>FileChannel</code> into the <code>Buffer</code>. The <code>int</code> returned by the <code>read()</code> method tells how many bytes were witten into the <code>Buffer</code>. If -1 is returned, the end-of-file is reached.</p>
<h2 id="writing-data-to-a-filechannel"><a name="user-content-writing-data-to-a-filechannel" href="#writing-data-to-a-filechannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Data to a FileChannel</h2>
<p>Writing data to a <code>FileChannel</code> is done using the <code>FileChannel.write()</code> method, which takes a <code>Buffer</code> as parameter. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String newData = &quot;New String to write to file...&quot; + System.currentTimeMillis();

ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();
buf.put(newData.getBytes());

buf.flip();

while(buf.hasRemaining()) {
    channel.write(buf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the <code>FileChannel.write()</code> method is called inside a while-loop. There is no guarantee of how many bytes the <code>write()</code> method writes to the <code>FileChannel.</code> Therefore we repeat the <code>write()</code> call until the <code>Buffer</code> has no further bytes to write.</p>
<h2 id="closing-a-filechannel"><a name="user-content-closing-a-filechannel" href="#closing-a-filechannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Closing a FileChannel</h2>
<p>When you are done using a <code>FileChannel</code> you must close it. Here is how that is done:</p>
<pre><code class="java">channel.close();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="filechannel-position"><a name="user-content-filechannel-position" href="#filechannel-position" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>FileChannel Position</h2>
<p>When reading or writing to a <code>FileChannel</code> you do so at a specific position. You can obtain the current position of the <code>FileChannel</code> object by calling the <code>position()</code> method.</p>
<p>You can also set the position of the <code>FileChannel</code> by calling the <code>position(long pos)</code> method.</p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<pre><code class="java">long pos channel.position();

channel.position(pos +123);
</code></pre>

<p>If you set the position after the end of the file, and try to read from the channel, you will get -1 - the end-of-file marker.</p>
<p>If you set the position after the end of the file, and write to the channel, the file will be expanded to fit the position and written data. This may result in a &ldquo;file hole&rdquo;, where the physical file on the disk has gaps in the written data.</p>
<h2 id="filechannel-size"><a name="user-content-filechannel-size" href="#filechannel-size" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>FileChannel Size</h2>
<p>The <code>size()</code> method of the <code>FileChannel</code> object returns the file size of the file the channel is connected to. Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">long fileSize = channel.size();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="filechannel-truncate"><a name="user-content-filechannel-truncate" href="#filechannel-truncate" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>FileChannel Truncate</h2>
<p>You can truncate a file by calling the <code>FileChannel.truncate()</code> method. When you truncate a file, you cut it off at a given length. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">channel.truncate(1024);
</code></pre>

<p>This example truncates the file at 1024 bytes in length.</p>
<h2 id="filechannel-force"><a name="user-content-filechannel-force" href="#filechannel-force" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>FileChannel Force</h2>
<p>The <code>FileChannel.force()</code> method flushes all unwritten data from the channel to the disk. An operating system may cache data in memory for performance reasons, so you are not guaranteed that data written to the channel is actually written to disk, until you call the <code>force()</code> method.</p>
<p>The <code>force()</code> method takes a boolean as parameter, telling whether the file meta data (permission etc.) should be flushed too.</p>
<p>Here is an example which flushes both data and meta data:</p>
<pre><code class="java">channel.force(true);
</code></pre>

<h1 id="java-nio-socketchannel"><a name="user-content-java-nio-socketchannel" href="#java-nio-socketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO SocketChannel</h1>
<p>A Java NIO SocketChannel is a channel that is connected to a TCP network socket. It is Java NIO&rsquo;s equivalent of <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-networking/sockets.html">Java Networking&rsquo;s Sockets</a>. There are two ways a <code>SocketChannel</code> can be created:</p>
<ol>
<li>You open a <code>SocketChannel</code> and connect to a server somewhere on the internet. </li>
<li>A <code>SocketChannel</code> can be created when an incoming connection arrives at a <a href="server-socket-channel.html">ServerSocketChannel</a>. </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="opening-a-socketchannel"><a name="user-content-opening-a-socketchannel" href="#opening-a-socketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Opening a SocketChannel</h2>
<p>Here is how you open a <code>SocketChannel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open();
socketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress(&quot;http://jenkov.com&quot;, 80));
</code></pre>

<h2 id="closing-a-socketchannel"><a name="user-content-closing-a-socketchannel" href="#closing-a-socketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Closing a SocketChannel</h2>
<p>You close a <code>SocketChannel</code> after use by calling the <code>SocketChannel.close()</code> method. Here is how that is done:</p>
<pre><code class="java">socketChannel.close();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="reading-from-a-socketchannel"><a name="user-content-reading-from-a-socketchannel" href="#reading-from-a-socketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading from a SocketChannel</h2>
<p>To read data from a <code>SocketChannel</code> you call one of the <code>read()</code> methods. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = socketChannel.read(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>First a <code>Buffer</code> is allocated. The data read from the <code>SocketChannel</code> is read into the <code>Buffer</code>.</p>
<p>Second the <code>SocketChannel.read()</code> method is called. This method reads data from the <code>SocketChannel</code> into the <code>Buffer</code>. The <code>int</code> returned by the <code>read()</code> method tells how many bytes were witten into the <code>Buffer</code>. If -1 is returned, the end-of-stream is reached (the connection is closed).</p>
<h2 id="writing-to-a-socketchannel"><a name="user-content-writing-to-a-socketchannel" href="#writing-to-a-socketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing to a SocketChannel</h2>
<p>Writing data to a <code>SocketChannel</code> is done using the <code>SocketChannel.write()</code> method, which takes a <code>Buffer</code> as parameter. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String newData = &quot;New String to write to file...&quot; + System.currentTimeMillis();

ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();
buf.put(newData.getBytes());

buf.flip();

while(buf.hasRemaining()) {
    channel.write(buf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the <code>SocketChannel.write()</code> method is called inside a while-loop. There is no guarantee of how many bytes the <code>write()</code> method writes to the <code>SocketChannel</code>. Therefore we repeat the <code>write()</code> call until the <code>Buffer</code> has no further bytes to write.</p>
<h2 id="non-blocking-mode"><a name="user-content-non-blocking-mode" href="#non-blocking-mode" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Non-blocking Mode</h2>
<p>You can set a <code>SocketChannel</code> into non-blocking mode. When you do so, you can call <code>connect()</code>, <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> in asynchronous mode.</p>
<h3 id="connect"><a name="user-content-connect" href="#connect" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>connect()</h3>
<p>If the <code>SocketChannel</code> is in non-blocking mode, and you call <code>connect()</code>, the method may return before a connection is established. To determine whether the connection is established, you can call the <code>finishConnect()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">socketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
socketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress(&quot;http://jenkov.com&quot;, 80));

while(! socketChannel.finishConnect() ){
    //wait, or do something else...    
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="write"><a name="user-content-write" href="#write" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>write()</h3>
<p>In non-blocking mode the <code>write()</code> method may return without having written anything. Therefore you need to call the <code>write()</code> method in a loop. But, since this is already being done in the previous write examples, no need to do anything differently here.</p>
<h3 id="read"><a name="user-content-read" href="#read" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>read()</h3>
<p>In non-blocking mode the <code>read()</code> method may return without having read any data at all. Therefore you need to pay attention to the returned <code>int</code>, which tells how many bytes were read.</p>
<h3 id="non-blocking-mode-with-selectors"><a name="user-content-non-blocking-mode-with-selectors" href="#non-blocking-mode-with-selectors" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Non-blocking Mode with Selectors</h3>
<p>The non-blocking mode of <code>SocketChannel</code>&lsquo;s works much better with <code>Selector</code>&lsquo;s. By registering one or more <code>SocketChannel</code>&lsquo;s with a <code>Selector</code>, you can ask the <code>Selector</code> for channels that are ready for reading, writing etc. How to use <code>Selector</code>&lsquo;s with <code>SocketChannel</code>&lsquo;s is explained in more detail in a later text in this tutorial.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-serversocketchannel"><a name="user-content-java-nio-serversocketchannel" href="#java-nio-serversocketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO ServerSocketChannel</h1>
<p>A Java NIO ServerSocketChannel is a channel that can listen for incoming TCP connections, just like a <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-networking/server-sockets.html">ServerSocket</a> in standard Java Networking. The <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> class is located in the <code>java.nio.channels</code> package.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();

serverSocketChannel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(9999));

while(true){
    SocketChannel socketChannel =
            serverSocketChannel.accept();

    //do something with socketChannel...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You open a <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> by calling the <code>ServerSocketChannel.open()</code> method. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="closing-a-serversocketchannel"><a name="user-content-closing-a-serversocketchannel" href="#closing-a-serversocketchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Closing a ServerSocketChannel</h2>
<p>Closing a <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> is done by calling the <code>ServerSocketChannel.close()</code> method. Here is how that looks:</p>
<p>serverSocketChannel.close();</p>
<h2 id="listening-for-incoming-connections"><a name="user-content-listening-for-incoming-connections" href="#listening-for-incoming-connections" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Listening for Incoming Connections</h2>
<p>Listening for incoming connections is done by calling the <code>ServerSocketChannel.accept()</code> method. When the <code>accept()</code> method returns, it returns a <code>SocketChannel</code> with an incoming connection. Thus, the <code>accept()</code> method blocks until an incoming connection arrives.</p>
<p>Since you are typically not interested in listening just for a single connection, you call the <code>accept()</code> inside a while-loop. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">while(true){
    SocketChannel socketChannel =
            serverSocketChannel.accept();

    //do something with socketChannel...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course you would use some other stop-criteria than <code>true</code> inside the while-loop.</p>
<h2 id="non-blocking-mode_1"><a name="user-content-non-blocking-mode_1" href="#non-blocking-mode_1" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Non-blocking Mode</h2>
<p>A <code>ServerSocketChannel</code> can be set into non-blocking mode. In non-blocking mode the <code>accept()</code> method returns immediately, and may thus return null, if no incoming connection had arrived. Therefore you will have to check if the returned <code>SocketChannel</code> is null. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ServerSocketChannel serverSocketChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();

serverSocketChannel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(9999));
serverSocketChannel.configureBlocking(false);

while(true){
    SocketChannel socketChannel =
            serverSocketChannel.accept();

    if(socketChannel != null){
        //do something with socketChannel...
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if you understand how the Java NIO non-blocking features work (<code>Selector</code>, <code>Channel</code>, <code>Buffer</code> etc.), designing a non-blocking server is still hard. Non-blocking IO contains several challenges compared blocking IO. This non-blocking server tutorial will discuss the major challenges of non-blocking servers, and describe some potential solutions for them.</p>
<p>Finding good information about designing non-blocking servers is hard. Therefore the solutions provided in this tutorial are based on my own work and ideas. If you have some alternative or even better ideas, I would be happy to hear about them! You can write a comment under the article or send me an email (see our <a href="http://jenkov.com/about/index.html">About page</a>), or <a href="https://twitter.com/jjenkov">catch me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The ideas described in this tutorial are designed around Java NIO. However, I believe that the ideas can be reused in other languages as long as they have some kind of <code>Selector</code>-like construct. As far as I know, such constructs are provided by the underlying OS, so there is a good chance that you can get access to this in other languages too.</p>

<p>I have created a simple proof-of-concept of the ideas presented in this tutorial and put it in a GitRebu repository for you to look at. Here is the GitHub repository:</p>

<p>A <em>non-blocking IO pipeline</em> is a chain of components that process non-blocking IO. This includes both reading and writing IO in a non-blocking fashion. Here is an illustration of a simplified non-blocking IO pipeline:</p>
<p><img alt="A simplified non-blocking IO pipeline." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-1.png" title="" /></p>
<p>A component uses an <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/selectors.html">Selector</a> to check when a <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/channels.html">Channel</a> has data to read. Then the component reads the input data and generates some output based on the input. The output is written to a <code>Channel</code> again.</p>
<p>A non-blocking IO pipeline does not need to both read and write data. Some pipelines may only read data, and some pipelines may only write data.</p>
<p>The above diagram only shows a single component. A non-blocking IO pipeline may have more than one component process incoming data. The length of a non-blocking IO pipeline depends on what the pipeline needs to do.</p>
<p>A non-blocking IO pipeline may also be reading from multiple <code>Channel</code>s at the same time. For instance, reading data from multiple <code>SocketChannel</code>s.</p>
<p>The flow of control in the above diagram is also simplified. It is the component that initiates the reading of data from the <code>Channel</code> via the <code>Selector</code>. It is not the <code>Channel</code> that pushes the data into the <code>Selector</code> and from there into the component, even if that is what the above diagram suggests.</p>
<h2 id="non-blocking-vs-blocking-io-pipelines"><a name="user-content-non-blocking-vs-blocking-io-pipelines" href="#non-blocking-vs-blocking-io-pipelines" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Non-blocking vs. Blocking IO Pipelines</h2>
<p>The biggest difference between a non-blocking and a blocking IO pipeline is how data is read from the underlying <code>Channel</code> (socket or file).</p>
<p>IO pipelines typically read data from some stream (from a socket or file) and split that data into coherent messages. This is similar to breaking a stream of data into tokens for parsing using a tokenizer. Instead, you break the stream of data into bigger messages. I will call the component breaking the stream into messages for a <em>Message Reader</em>. Here is an illustration of a Message Reader breaking a stream into messages:</p>
<p><img alt="A Message Reader breaking a stream into messages." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-2.png" title="" /></p>
<p>A blocking IO pipeline can use an <code>InputStream</code>-like interface where one byte at a time can be read from the underlying <code>Channel</code>, and where the <code>InputStream</code>-like interface blocks until there is data ready to read. This results in a blocking Message Reader implementation.</p>
<p>Using a blocking IO interface to a stream simplifies the implementation of a Message Reader a lot. A blocking Message Reader never has to handle situations where no data was read from the stream, or where only a partial message was read from the stream and message parsing needs to be resumed later.</p>
<p>Similarly, a blocking Message Writer (a component that writes messages to a stream) never has to handle the situation where only part of a message was written, and where message writing has to be resumed later.</p>
<h3 id="blocking-io-pipeline-drawbacks"><a name="user-content-blocking-io-pipeline-drawbacks" href="#blocking-io-pipeline-drawbacks" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Blocking IO Pipeline Drawbacks</h3>
<p>While a blocking Message Reader is easier to implement, it has the unfortunate drawback of requiring a separate thread for each stream that needs to be split into messages. The reason this is necessary is that the IO interface of each stream blocks until there is some data to read from it. That means that a single thread cannot attempt to read from one stream, and if there is no data, read from another stream. As soon as a thread attempts to read data from a stream, the thread blocks until there is actually some data to read.</p>
<p>If the IO pipeline is part of a server which has to handle lots of concurrent connections, the server will need one thread per active ingoing connection. This may not be a problem if the server only has a few hundred concurrent connections at any time. But, if the server has millions of concurrent connections, this type of design does not scale so well. Each thread will take between 320K (32 bit JVM) and 1024K (64 bit JVM) memory for its stack. So, 1.000.000 threads will take 1 TB memory! And that is before the server has used any memory for processing the incoming messages (e.g. memory allocated for objects used during message processing).</p>
<p>To keep the number of threads down, many servers use a design where the server keeps a pool of threads (e.g. 100) which reads messages from the inbound connections one at a time. The inbound connections are kept in a queue, and the threads process messages from each inbound connection in the sequence the inbound connections are put into the queue. This design is illustrated here:</p>
<p><img alt="A pool of threads reading messages from streams in a queue." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-3.png" title="" /></p>
<p>However, this design requires that the inbound connections send data reasonably often. If the inbound connections may be inactive for longer periods, a high number of inactive connections may actually block all the threads in the thread pool. That means that the server becomes slow to respond or even unresponsive.</p>
<p>Some server designs try to mitigate this problem by having some elasticity in the number of threads in the thread pool. For instance, if the thread pool runs out of threads, the thread pool might start more threads to handle the load. This solution means that it takes a higher number of slow connections to make the server unresponsive. But remember, there is still an upper limit to how many threads you can have running. So, this would not scale well with 1.000.000 slow connections.</p>

<p>A non-blocking IO pipeline can use a single thread to read messages from multiple streams. This requires that the streams can be switched to non-blocking mode. When in non-blocking mode, a stream may return 0 or more bytes when you attempt to read data from it. The 0 bytes is returned if the stream has no data to read. The 1+ bytes are returned when the stream actually has some data to read.</p>
<p>To avoid checking streams that has 0 bytes to read we use a <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/selectors.html">Java NIO Selector</a>. One or more <code>SelectableChannel</code> instances can be registered with a <code>Selector</code>. When you call <code>select()</code> or <code>selectNow()</code> on the <code>Selector</code> it gives you only the <code>SelectableChannel</code> instances that actually has data to read. This design is illustrated here:</p>

<h2 id="reading-partial-messages"><a name="user-content-reading-partial-messages" href="#reading-partial-messages" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Partial Messages</h2>
<p>When we read a block of data from a <code>SelectableChannel</code> we do not know if that data block contains less or more than a message. A data block could potentially contain a partial message (less than a message), a full message, or more than a message, for instance 1.5 or 2.5 messsages. The various partial message possibilities are illustrated here:</p>
<p><img alt="A data block can contain less than or more than a single message." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-5.png" title="" /></p>
<p>There are two challenges in handling partial messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detecting if you have a full message in the data block.</li>
<li>What to do with partial messages until the rest of the message arrives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Detecting full messages requires that the Message Reader looks at the data in the data block to see if the data contains at least one full message. If the data block contains one or more full messages, these messages can be sent down the pipeline for processing. The process of looking for full messages will be repeated a lot, so this process has to be as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a partial message in a data block, either by itself or after one or more full messages, that partial message needs to be stored until the rest of that message arrives from the <code>Channel</code>.</p>
<p>Both detecting full messages and storing partial messages is the responsibility of the Message Reader. To avoid mixing message data from different <code>Channel</code> instances we will use one Message Reader per <code>Channel</code>. The design looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A component reading messages via a Message Reader." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-6.png" title="" /></p>
<p>After retrieving a <code>Channel</code> instance which has data to read from the <code>Selector</code>, the the Message Reader associated with that <code>Channel</code> reads data and attempt to break it it into messages. If that results in any full messages being read, these message can be passed down the read pipeline to whatever component needs to process them.</p>
<p>A Message Reader is of course protocol specific. A Message Reader needs to know the message format of the messages it is trying to read. If our server implementation is to be reusable across protocols, it needs to be able to have the Message Reader implementation plugged in - possibly by accepting a Message Reader factory as configuration parameter somehow.</p>
<h2 id="storing-partial-messages"><a name="user-content-storing-partial-messages" href="#storing-partial-messages" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Storing Partial Messages</h2>
<p>Now that we have established that it is the responsibility of the Message Reader to store partial messages until a full message has been received, we need to figure out how this partial message storage should be implemented.</p>
<p>There are two design considerations we should take into consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to copy message data around as little as possible. The more copying, the lower performance.</li>
<li>We want full messages to be stored in consecutive byte sequences to make parsing messages easier.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-buffer-per-message-reader"><a name="user-content-a-buffer-per-message-reader" href="#a-buffer-per-message-reader" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>A Buffer Per Message Reader</h3>
<p>Obviously the partial messages need to be stored in some kind of buffer. The straightforward implementation would be to simply have one buffer internally in each Message Reader. However, how big should that buffer be? It would need to be big enough to be able to store even the biggest allowed messages. So, if the biggest allowed message is 1MB, then the internal buffer in each Message Reader would need to be at least 1MB.</p>
<p>Using 1MB per connection doesn&rsquo;t really work when we reach millions of connections. 1.000.000 x 1MB is still 1TB memory! And what if the maximum message size is 16MB? Or 128MB ?</p>
<h3 id="resizable-buffers"><a name="user-content-resizable-buffers" href="#resizable-buffers" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Resizable Buffers</h3>
<p>Another option would be to implement a resizable buffer for use inside each Message Reader. A resizable buffer will start small, and if a message gets too big for the buffer, the buffer is expanded. This way each connection will not necessarily require an e.g. 1MB buffer. Each connection only takes as much memory as they need to hold the next message.</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement a resizable buffer. All of them have advantages and disadvantages, so I will discuss them all in the following sections.</p>
<h3 id="resize-by-copy"><a name="user-content-resize-by-copy" href="#resize-by-copy" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Resize by Copy</h3>
<p>The first way to implement a resizable buffer is to start with a small buffer of e.g. 4KB. If a message cannot fit into the 4KB buffer, a larger buffer of e.g. 8KB could be allocated, and the data from the 4KB buffer copied into the bigger buffer.</p>
<p>The advantage of the resize-by-copy buffer implementation is that all data for a message is kept together in a single consecutive byte array. This makes parsing the message much easier.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the resize-by-copy buffer implementation is that it will lead to a lot of data copying for bigger messages.</p>
<p>To reduce data copying you could analyze the size of the messages flowing through your system to find some buffer sizes that would reduce the amount of copying. For instance, you might see that most messages are less than 4KB because they only contain very small requests / responses. That means that the first buffer size should be 4KB.</p>
<p>Then you might see that if a message is larger than 4KB it is often because it contains a file. You might then notice that most of the files flowing through the system is less than 128KB. Then it makes sense to make the second buffer size 128KB.</p>
<p>Finally you might see that once a message is above 128KB there is no real pattern in how large the message is, so perhaps the final buffer size should just be the maximum message size.</p>
<p>With these 3 buffer sizes based on the size of messages flowing through your system, you will have reduced data copying somewhat. Messages below 4KB will never be copied. For 1.000.000 concurrent connections that results in 1.000.000 x 4KB = 4GB which is possible in most servers today (2015). Messages between 4KB and 128KB will get copied once, and only 4KB data will need to be copied into the 128KB buffer. Messages between 128KB and maximum message size will be copied twice. First time 4KB will get copied, second time 128KB will get copied, so a total of 132KB copying for the biggest messages. Assuming that there are not that many messages above 128KB this might be acceptable.</p>
<p>Once a message has been fully processed the allocated memory should be freed again. That way the next message received from the same connection starts with the smallest buffer size again. This is necessary to make sure that the memory can be shared more efficiently between connections. Most likely not all connections will need big buffers at the same time.</p>
<p>I have a complete tutorial about how to implement such a memory buffer that supports resizable arrays here: <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-performance/resizable-array.html">Resizable Arrays</a> . The tutorial also contains a link to a GitHub repository with code showing a working implementation.</p>
<h3 id="resize-by-append"><a name="user-content-resize-by-append" href="#resize-by-append" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Resize by Append</h3>
<p>Another way to resize a buffer is to make the buffer consist of multiple arrays. When you need to resize the buffer you simply allocate another byte array and write the data into that.</p>
<p>There are two ways to grow such a buffer. One way is to allocate separate byte arrays and keep a list of these byte arrays. Another way is to allocate slices of a larger, shared byte array, and then keep a list of the slices allocated to the buffer. Personally, I feel the slices approach is slightly better, but the difference is small.</p>
<p>The advantage of growing a buffer by appending separate arrays or slices to it is that no data needs to be copied during writing. All data can be copied directly from a socket (<code>Channel</code>) directly into an array or slice.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of growing a buffer this way is that the data is not stored in a single, consecutive array. This makes message parsing harder, since the parsers need to look out for both the end of every individual array and the end of all arrays at the same time. Since you need to look for the end of a message in the written data, this model is not too easy to work with.</p>
<h3 id="tlv-encoded-messages"><a name="user-content-tlv-encoded-messages" href="#tlv-encoded-messages" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>TLV Encoded Messages</h3>
<p>Some protocol message formats are encoded using a TLV format (Type, Length, Value). That means, that when a message arrives the total length of the message is stored in the beginning of the message. That way you know immediately how much memory to allocate for the whole message.</p>
<p>TLV encodings make memory management much easier. You know immediately how much memory to allocate for the message. No memory is wasted at the end of a buffer that is only partially used.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of TLV encodings is that you allocate all the memory for a message before all the data of the message has arrived. A few, slow connections sending big messages can thus allocate all the memory you have available, making your server unresponsive.</p>
<p>A workaround for this problem would be to use a message format that contains multiple TLV fields inside. Thus, memory is allocated for each field, not for the whole message, and memory is only allocated as the fields arrive. Still, a large field can have the same effect on your memory management as a large message.</p>
<p>Another workaround is to time out messages which have not been received within e.g. 10-15 seconds. This can make your server recover from a coincidental, simultaneous arrival of many big messages, but it will still make the server unresponsive for a while. Additionally, an intentional DoS (Denial of Service) attack can still result in full allocation of the memory for your server.</p>
<p>TLV encodings exist in different variations. Exactly how many bytes is used so specify the type and length of a field depends on each individual TLV encoding. There are also TLV encodings that put the length of the field first, then the type, and then the value (an LTV encoding). While the sequence of the fields is different, it is still a TLV variation.</p>
<p>The fact that TLV encodings makes memory management easier is one of the reasons why HTTP 1.1 is such a terrible protocol. That is one of the problems they are trying to fix in HTTP 2.0 where data is transported in LTV encoded frames. This is also why we have designed our own network protocol for our <a href="http://vstack.co">VStack.co project</a> that uses a TLV encoding.</p>
<h2 id="writing-partial-messages"><a name="user-content-writing-partial-messages" href="#writing-partial-messages" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Partial Messages</h2>
<p>In a non-blocking IO pipeline writing data is also a challenge. When you call <code>write(ByteBuffer)</code> on a <code>Channel</code> in non-blocking mode there is no guarantee about how many of the bytes in the <code>ByteBuffer</code> is being written. The <code>write(ByteBuffer)</code> method returns how many bytes were written, so it is possible to keep track of the number of written bytes. And that is the challenge: Keeping track of partially written messages so that in the end all bytes of a message have been sent.</p>
<p>To manage the writing of partial messages to a <code>Channel</code> we will create a Message Writer. Just like with the Message Reader, we will need a Message Writer per <code>Channel</code> we write messages to. Inside each Message Writer we keep track of exactly how many bytes have been written of the message it is currently writing.</p>
<p>In case more messages arrives for a Message Writer than it can write directly out to the <code>Channel</code>, the messages needs to be queued up internally in the Message Writer. The Message Writer then writes the messages as fast as it can to the <code>Channel</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram showing how the partial message writing is designed so far:</p>
<p><img alt="A component sending messages to a Message Writer which queue them up and send them to a Channel." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-8.png" title="" /></p>
<p>For the Message Writer to be able to send messages that were only partially sent earlier, the Message Writer needs to be called from time to time, so it can send more data.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of connections you will have a lot of Message Writer instances. Checking e.g. a million Message Writer instances to see if they can write any data is slow. First of all, many of the Message Writer instance many not have any messages to send. We don&rsquo;t want to check those Message Writer instances. Second, not all <code>Channel</code> instances may be ready to write data to. We don&rsquo;t want to waste time trying to write data to a <code>Channel</code> that cannot accept any data anyways.</p>
<p>To check if a <code>Channel</code> is ready for writing you can register the channel with a <code>Selector</code>. However, we do not want to register all <code>Channel</code> instances with the <code>Selector</code>. Imagine if you have 1.000.000 connections which are mostly idle and all 1.000.000 connections were registered with the <code>Selector</code>. Then, when you call <code>select()</code> most of these <code>Channel</code> instances would be write-ready (they are mostly idle, remember?). You would then have to check the Message Writer of all those connections to see if they had any data to write.</p>
<p>To avoid checking all Message Writer instances for messages, and all <code>Channel</code> instances which anyways do not have any messages to be sent to them, we use this two-step approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>When a message is written to a Message Writer, the Message Writer registers its associated <code>Channel</code> with the <code>Selector</code> (if it is not already registered). </li>
<li>When your server has time, it checks the <code>Selector</code> to see which of the registered <code>Channel</code> instances are ready for writing. For each write-ready <code>Channel</code> its associated Message Writer is requested to write data to the <code>Channel</code>. If a Message Writer writes all its messages to its <code>Channel</code>, the <code>Channel</code> is unregistered from the <code>Selector</code> again. </li>
</ol>
<p>This little two-step approach makes sure that only <code>Channel</code> instances that have messages to be written to them are actually registered with the <code>Selector</code>.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a name="user-content-putting-it-all-together" href="#putting-it-all-together" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p>As you can see, a non-blocking server needs to check for incoming data from time to time to see if there are any new full messages received. The server might need to check multiple times until one or more full messages have been received. Checking one time is not enough.</p>
<p>Similarly, a non-blocking server needs to check from time to time if there is any data to write. If yes, the server needs to check if any of the corresponding connections are ready to have that data written to them. Checking only when a message is queued up the first time is not enough, since the message might be written partially.</p>
<p>All in all a non-blocking server ends up with three &ldquo;pipelines&rdquo; it needs to execute regularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The read pipeline which checks for new incoming data from the open connections.</li>
<li>The process pipeline which processes any full messages received.</li>
<li>The write pipeline which checks if it can write any outgoing messages to any of the open connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three pipelines are executed repeatedly in a loop. You might be able to optimize the execution somewhat. For instance, if there are no messages queued up you can skip the write pipeline. Or, if there we no new, full messages received, perhaps you can skip the process pipeline.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram illustrating the full server loop:</p>
<p><img alt="The full server loop of a non-blocking server." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-9.png" title="" /></p>
<p>If you still find this a bit complicated, remember to check out the GitHub repository:</p>

<p>Maybe seeing the code in action might help you understand how to implement this.</p>
<h2 id="server-thread-model"><a name="user-content-server-thread-model" href="#server-thread-model" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Server Thread Model</h2>
<p>The non-blocking server implementation in the GitHub repository uses a thread model with 2 threads. The first thread accepts incoming connections from a <code>ServerSocketChannel</code>. The second thread processes the accepted connections, meaning reading messages, processing the messages and writing responses back to the connections. This 2 thread model is illustrated here:</p>
<p><img alt="The 2 thread model for the non-blocking server implemented in the GitHub repository." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/non-blocking-server-10.png" title="" /></p>
<p>The server processing loop explained in the previous section is executed by the processing thread.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-datagramchannel"><a name="user-content-java-nio-datagramchannel" href="#java-nio-datagramchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO DatagramChannel</h1>
<p>A Java NIO DatagramChannel is a channel that can send and receive UDP packets. Since UDP is a connection-less network protocol, you cannot just by default read and write to a <code>DatagramChannel</code> like you do from other channels. Instead you send and receive packets of data.</p>
<h2 id="opening-a-datagramchannel"><a name="user-content-opening-a-datagramchannel" href="#opening-a-datagramchannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Opening a DatagramChannel</h2>
<p>Here is how you open a <code>DatagramChannel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">DatagramChannel channel = DatagramChannel.open();
channel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(9999));
</code></pre>

<p>This example opens a <code>DatagramChannel</code> which can receive packets on UDP port 9999.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-data"><a name="user-content-receiving-data" href="#receiving-data" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Receiving Data</h2>
<p>You receive data from a <code>DatagramChannel</code> by calling its <code>receive()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();

channel.receive(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>receive()</code> method will copy the content of a received packet of data into the given <code>Buffer</code>. If the received packet contains more data than the <code>Buffer</code> can contain, the remaining data is discarded silently.</p>
<h2 id="sending-data"><a name="user-content-sending-data" href="#sending-data" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Sending Data</h2>
<p>You can send data via a <code>DatagramChannel</code> by calling its <code>send()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String newData = &quot;New String to write to file...&quot;
                    + System.currentTimeMillis();

ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();
buf.put(newData.getBytes());
buf.flip();

int bytesSent = channel.send(buf, new InetSocketAddress(&quot;jenkov.com&quot;, 80));
</code></pre>

<p>This example sends the string to the &ldquo;jenkov.com&rdquo; server on UDP port 80. Nothing is listening on that port though, so nothing will happen. You will not be notified of whether the send packet was received or not, since UDP does not make any guarantees about delivery of data.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-to-a-specific-address"><a name="user-content-connecting-to-a-specific-address" href="#connecting-to-a-specific-address" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Connecting to a Specific Address</h2>
<p>It is possible to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; a <code>DatagramChannel</code> to a specific address on the network. Since UDP is connection-less, this way of connecting to an address does not create a real connection, like with a TCP channel. Rather, it locks your <code>DatagramChannel</code> so you can only send and receive data packets from one specific address.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">channel.connect(new InetSocketAddress(&quot;jenkov.com&quot;, 80));
</code></pre>

<p>When connected you can also use the <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code> method, as if you were using a traditional channel. You just don&rsquo;t have any guarantees about delivery of the sent data. Here are a few examples:</p>
<pre><code class="java">int bytesRead = channel.read(buf);
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="java">int bytesWritten = channel.write(buf);
</code></pre>

<h1 id="java-nio-pipe"><a name="user-content-java-nio-pipe" href="#java-nio-pipe" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Pipe</h1>
<p>A Java NIO Pipe is a one-way data connection between two threads. A <code>Pipe</code> has a source channel and a sink channel. You write data to the sink channel. This data can then be read from the source channel.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the <code>Pipe</code> principle:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Pipe Internals" src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/pipe-internals.png" title="" /></p>
<h2 id="creating-a-pipe"><a name="user-content-creating-a-pipe" href="#creating-a-pipe" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating a Pipe</h2>
<p>You open a <code>Pipe</code> by calling the <code>Pipe.open()</code> method. Here is how that looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Pipe pipe = Pipe.open();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="writing-to-a-pipe"><a name="user-content-writing-to-a-pipe" href="#writing-to-a-pipe" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing to a Pipe</h2>
<p>To write to a <code>Pipe</code> you need to access the sink channel. Here is how that is done:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Pipe.SinkChannel sinkChannel = pipe.sink();
</code></pre>

<p>You write to a <code>SinkChannel</code> by calling it&rsquo;s <code>write()</code> method, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String newData = &quot;New String to write to file...&quot; + System.currentTimeMillis();

ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
buf.clear();
buf.put(newData.getBytes());

buf.flip();

while(buf.hasRemaining()) {
    sinkChannel.write(buf);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To read from a <code>Pipe</code> you need to access the source channel. Here is how that is done:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Pipe.SourceChannel sourceChannel = pipe.source();
</code></pre>

<p>To read from the source channel you call its <code>read()</code> method like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>int</code> returned by the <code>read()</code> method tells how many bytes were read into the buffer.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-vs-io"><a name="user-content-java-nio-vs-io" href="#java-nio-vs-io" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO vs. IO</h1>
<p>When studying both the Java NIO and IO API&rsquo;s, a question quickly pops into mind:</p>
<p>When should I use IO and when should I use NIO?</p>
<p>In this text I will try to shed some light on the differences between Java NIO and IO, their use cases, and how they affect the design of your code.</p>
<h2 id="main-differences-betwen-java-nio-and-io"><a name="user-content-main-differences-betwen-java-nio-and-io" href="#main-differences-betwen-java-nio-and-io" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Main Differences Betwen Java NIO and IO</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the main differences between Java NIO and IO. I will get into more detail about each difference in the sections following the table.</p>
<h2 id="stream-oriented-vs-buffer-oriented"><a name="user-content-stream-oriented-vs-buffer-oriented" href="#stream-oriented-vs-buffer-oriented" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Stream Oriented vs. Buffer Oriented</h2>
<p>The first big difference between Java NIO and IO is that IO is stream oriented, where NIO is buffer oriented. So, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Java IO being stream oriented means that you read one or more bytes at a time, from a stream. What you do with the read bytes is up to you. They are not cached anywhere. Furthermore, you cannot move forth and back in the data in a stream. If you need to move forth and back in the data read from a stream, you will need to cache it in a buffer first.</p>
<p>Java NIO&rsquo;s buffer oriented approach is slightly different. Data is read into a buffer from which it is later processed. You can move forth and back in the buffer as you need to. This gives you a bit more flexibility during processing. However, you also need to check if the buffer contains all the data you need in order to fully process it. And, you need to make sure that when reading more data into the buffer, you do not overwrite data in the buffer you have not yet processed.</p>
<h2 id="blocking-vs-non-blocking-io"><a name="user-content-blocking-vs-non-blocking-io" href="#blocking-vs-non-blocking-io" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Blocking vs. Non-blocking IO</h2>
<p>Java IO&rsquo;s various streams are blocking. That means, that when a thread invokes a <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code>, that thread is blocked until there is some data to read, or the data is fully written. The thread can do nothing else in the meantime.</p>
<p>Java NIO&rsquo;s non-blocking mode enables a thread to request reading data from a channel, and only get what is currently available, or nothing at all, if no data is currently available. Rather than remain blocked until data becomes available for reading, the thread can go on with something else.</p>
<p>The same is true for non-blocking writing. A thread can request that some data be written to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread can then go on and do something else in the mean time.</p>
<p>What threads spend their idle time on when not blocked in IO calls, is usually performing IO on other channels in the meantime. That is, a single thread can now manage multiple channels of input and output.</p>
<h2 id="selectors_1"><a name="user-content-selectors_1" href="#selectors_1" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Selectors</h2>
<p>Java NIO&rsquo;s selectors allow a single thread to monitor multiple channels of input. You can register multiple channels with a selector, then use a single thread to &ldquo;select&rdquo; the channels that have input available for processing, or select the channels that are ready for writing. This selector mechanism makes it easy for a single thread to manage multiple channels.</p>

<p>Of course the API calls when using NIO look different than when using IO. This is no surprise. Rather than just read the data byte for byte from e.g. an <code>InputStream</code>, the data must first be read into a buffer, and then be processed from there.</p>
<h3 id="the-processing-of-data"><a name="user-content-the-processing-of-data" href="#the-processing-of-data" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>The Processing of Data</h3>
<p>The processing of the data is also affected when using a pure NIO design, vs. an IO design.</p>
<p>In an IO design you read the data byte for byte from an <code>InputStream</code> or a <code>Reader</code>. Imagine you were processing a stream of line based textual data. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Name: Anna
Age: 25
Email: anna@mailserver.com
Phone: 1234567890
</code></pre>

<p>This stream of text lines could be processed like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">InputStream input = ... ; // get the InputStream from the client socket

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));

String nameLine   = reader.readLine();
String ageLine    = reader.readLine();
String emailLine  = reader.readLine();
String phoneLine  = reader.readLine();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the processing state is determined by how far the program has executed. In other words, once the first <code>reader.readLine()</code> method returns, you know for sure that a full line of text has been read. The <code>readLine()</code> blocks until a full line is read, that&rsquo;s why. You also know that this line contains the name. Similarly, when the second <code>readLine()</code> call returns, you know that this line contains the age etc.</p>
<p>As you can see, the program progresses only when there is new data to read, and for each step you know what that data is. Once the executing thread have progressed past reading a certain piece of data in the code, the thread is not going backwards in the data (mostly not). This principle is also illustrated in this diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="Java IO: Reading data from a blocking stream." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/nio-vs-io-1.png" title="" /></p>
<p>A NIO implementation would look different. Here is a simplified example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buffer);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the second line which reads bytes from the channel into the <code>ByteBuffer</code>. When that method call returns you don&rsquo;t know if all the data you need is inside the buffer. All you know is that the buffer contains some bytes. This makes processing somewhat harder.</p>
<p>Imagine if, after the first <code>read(buffer)</code> call, that all what was read into the buffer was half a line. For instance, &ldquo;Name: An&rdquo;. Can you process that data? Not really. You need to wait until at leas a full line of data has been into the buffer, before it makes sense to process any of the data at all.</p>
<p>So how do you know if the buffer contains enough data for it to make sense to be processed? Well, you don&rsquo;t. The only way to find out, is to look at the data in the buffer. The result is, that you may have to inspect the data in the buffer several times before you know if all the data is inthere. This is both inefficient, and can become messy in terms of program design. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="java">ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buffer);

while(! bufferFull(bytesRead) ) {
    bytesRead = inChannel.read(buffer);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>bufferFull()</code> method has to keep track of how much data is read into the buffer, and return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, depending on whether the buffer is full. In other words, if the buffer is ready for processing, it is considered full.</p>
<p>The <code>bufferFull()</code> method scans through the buffer, but must leave the buffer in the same state as before the <code>bufferFull()</code> method was called. If not, the next data read into the buffer might not be read in at the correct location. This is not impossible, but it is yet another issue to watch out for.</p>
<p>If the buffer is full, it can be processed. If it is not full, you might be able to partially process whatever data is there, if that makes sense in your particular case. In many cases it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The is-data-in-buffer-ready loop is illustrated in this diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: Reading data from a channel until all needed data is in buffer." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/nio-vs-io-2.png" title="" /></p>
<h2 id="summary"><a name="user-content-summary" href="#summary" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Summary</h2>
<p>NIO allows you to manage multiple channels (network connections or files) using only a single (or few) threads, but the cost is that parsing the data might be somewhat more complicated than when reading data from a blocking stream.</p>
<p>If you need to manage thousands of open connections simultanously, which each only send a little data, for instance a chat server, implementing the server in NIO is probably an advantage. Similarly, if you need to keep a lot of open connections to other computers, e.g. in a P2P network, using a single thread to manage all of your outbound connections might be an advantage. This one thread, multiple connections design is illustrated in this diagram:</p>
<p><img alt="Java NIO: A single thread managing multiple connections." src="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-nio/nio-vs-io-3.png" title="" /></p>
<p>If you have fewer connections with very high bandwidth, sending a lot of data at a time, perhaps a classic IO server implementation might be the best fit. This diagram illustrates a classic IO server design:</p>

<h1 id="java-nio-path"><a name="user-content-java-nio-path" href="#java-nio-path" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Path</h1>
<p>The Java <code>Path</code> interface is part of the Java NIO 2 update which Java NIO received in Java 6 and Java 7. The Java <code>Path</code> interface was added to Java NIO in Java 7. The <code>Path</code> interface is located in the <code>java.nio.file</code> package, so the fully qualified name of the Java <code>Path</code> interface is <code>java.nio.file.Path</code>.</p>
<p>A Java <code>Path</code> instance represents a <em>path</em> in the file system. A path can point to either a file or a directory. A path can be absolute or relative. An absolute path contains the full path from the root of the file system down to the file or directory it points to. A relative path contains the path to the file or directory relative to some other path. Relative paths may sound a bit confusing. Don&rsquo;t worry. I will explain relative paths in more detail later in this Java NIO Path tutorial.</p>
<p>Do not confuse a <em>file system path</em> with the <code>path</code> environment variable in some operating systems. The <code>java.nio.file.Path</code> interface has nothing to do with the <code>path</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>In many ways the <code>java.nio.file.Path</code> interface is similar to the <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-io/file.html">java.io.File</a> class, but there are some minor differences. In many cases though, you can replace the use of the <code>File</code> class with use of the <code>Path</code> interface.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-path-instance"><a name="user-content-creating-a-path-instance" href="#creating-a-path-instance" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating a Path Instance</h2>
<p>In order to use a <code>java.nio.file.Path</code> instance you must create a <code>Path</code> instance. You create a <code>Path</code> instance using a static method in the <code>Paths</code> class (<code>java.nio.file.Paths</code>) named <code>Paths.get()</code>. Here is a Java <code>Paths.get()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class PathExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Path path = Paths.get(&quot;c:\\data\\myfile.txt&quot;);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the two <code>import</code> statements at the top of the example. To use the <code>Path</code> interface and the <code>Paths</code> class we must first import them.</p>
<p>Second, notice the <code>Paths.get("c:\\data\\myfile.txt")</code> method call. It is the call to the <code>Paths.get()</code> method that creates the <code>Path</code> instance. The <code>Paths.get()</code> method is a factory method for <code>Path</code> instances, in other words.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-absolute-path"><a name="user-content-creating-an-absolute-path" href="#creating-an-absolute-path" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating an Absolute Path</h3>
<p>Creating an absolute path is done by calling the <code>Paths.get()</code> factory method with the absolute file as parameter. Here is an example of creating a <code>Path</code> instance representing an absolute path:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;c:\\data\\myfile.txt&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The absolute path is <code>c:\data\myfile.txt</code>. The double <code>\</code> characters are necessary in Java strings, since the <code>\</code> is an escape character, meaning the following character tells what character is really to be located at this place in the string. By writing <code>\\</code> you tell the Java compiler to write a single <code>\</code> character into the string.</p>
<p>The above path is a Windows file system path. On a Unix system (Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD etc.) the above absolute path could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;/home/jakobjenkov/myfile.txt&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The absolute path is now <code>/home/jakobjenkov/myfile.txt</code> .</p>
<p>If you used this kind of path on a Windows machine (a path starting with <code>/</code>) the path would be interpreted as relative to the current drive. For instance, the path</p>
<pre><code class="java">/home/jakobjenkov/myfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>could be interpreted as being located on the C drive. Then the path would correspond to this full path:</p>
<pre><code class="java">C:/home/jakobjenkov/myfile.txt
</code></pre>

<h3 id="creating-a-relative-path"><a name="user-content-creating-a-relative-path" href="#creating-a-relative-path" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating a Relative Path</h3>
<p>A relative path is a path that points from one path (the base path) to a directory or file. The full path (the absolute path) of a relative path is derived by combining the base path with the relative path.</p>
<p>The Java NIO <code>Path</code> class can also be used to work with relative paths. You create a relative path using the <code>Paths.get(basePath, relativePath)</code> method. Here are two relative path examples in Java:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path projects = Paths.get(&quot;d:\\data&quot;, &quot;projects&quot;);

Path file     = Paths.get(&quot;d:\\data&quot;, &quot;projects\\a-project\\myfile.txt&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The first example creates a Java <code>Path</code> instance which points to the path (directory) <code>d:\data\projects</code>. The second example creates a <code>Path</code> instance which points to the path (file) <code>d:\data\projects\a-project\myfile.txt</code> .</p>
<p>When working with relative paths there are two special codes you can use inside the path string. These codes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>.</li>
<li>..</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>.</code> code means &ldquo;current directory&rdquo;. For instance, if you create a relative path like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path currentDir = Paths.get(&quot;.&quot;);
System.out.println(currentDir.toAbsolutePath());
</code></pre>

<p>Then the absolute path the Java <code>Path</code> instance corresponds to will be the directory in which the application executing the above code is executed.</p>
<p>If the <code>.</code> is used in the middle of a path string it just means the same directory as the path was pointing to at that point. Here is an <code>Path</code> example illustrating that:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path currentDir = Paths.get(&quot;d:\\data\\projects\.\a-project&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>This path will correspond to the path:</p>
<pre><code class="java">d:\data\projects\a-project
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>..</code> code means &ldquo;parent directory&rdquo; or &ldquo;one directory up&rdquo;. Here is a <code>Path</code> Java example illustrating that:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path parentDir = Paths.get(&quot;..&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Path</code> instance created by this example would correspond to the parent directory of the directory from which the application running this code was started.</p>
<p>If you use the <code>..</code> code in the middle of a path string it will correspond to changing one directory up at that point in the path string. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String path = &quot;d:\\data\\projects\\a-project\\..\\another-project&quot;;
Path parentDir2 = Paths.get(path);
</code></pre>

<p>The Java <code>Path</code> instance created by this example will correspond to this absolute path:</p>
<pre><code class="java">d:\data\projects\another-project
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>..</code> code after the <code>a-project</code> directory changes directory up the the parent directory <code>projects</code> and then the path references down into the <code>another-project</code> directory from there.</p>
<p>The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> codes also work in combination with the two-string <code>Paths.get()</code> method. Here are two Java <code>Paths.get()</code> examples showing simple examples of that:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path1 = Paths.get(&quot;d:\\data\\projects&quot;, &quot;.\\a-project&quot;);

Path path2 = Paths.get(&quot;d:\\data\\projects\\a-project&quot;,
                       &quot;..\\another-project&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>There are more ways that the Java NIO <code>Path</code> class can be used to work with relative paths. You will learn more about that later in this tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="pathnormalize"><a name="user-content-pathnormalize" href="#pathnormalize" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Path.normalize()</h2>
<p>The <code>normalize()</code> method of the <code>Path</code> interface can normalize a path. Normalizing means that it removes all the <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> codes in the middle of the path string, and resolves what path the path string refers to. Here is a Java <code>Path.normalize()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">String originalPath =
        &quot;d:\\data\\projects\\a-project\\..\\another-project&quot;;

Path path1 = Paths.get(originalPath);
System.out.println(&quot;path1 = &quot; + path1);

Path path2 = path1.normalize();
System.out.println(&quot;path2 = &quot; + path2);
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>Path</code> example first creates a path string with a <code>..</code> code in the middle. Then the example creates a <code>Path</code> instance from this path string, and prints that <code>Path</code> instance out (actually it prints <code>Path.toString()</code>).</p>
<p>The example then calls <code>normalize()</code> on the created <code>Path</code> instance, which returns a new <code>Path</code> instance. This new, normalized <code>Path</code> instance is then also printed out.</p>
<p>Here is the output printed from the above example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">path1 = d:\data\projects\a-project\..\another-project
path2 = d:\data\projects\another-project
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the normalized path does not contain the <code>a-project\..</code> part, as this is redundant. The removed part adds nothing to the final absolute path.</p>
<h1 id="java-nio-files"><a name="user-content-java-nio-files" href="#java-nio-files" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Java NIO Files</h1>
<p>The Java NIO <code>Files</code> class (<code>java.nio.file.Files</code>) provides several methods for manipulating files in the file system. This Java NIO <code>Files</code> tutorial will cover the most commonly used of these methods. The <code>Files</code> class contains many methods, so check the JavaDoc too, if you need a method that is not described here. The <code>Files</code> class just might have a method for it still.</p>
<p>The <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> class works with <a href="path.html">java.nio.file.Path</a> instances, so you need to understand the <code>Path</code> class before you can work with the <code>Files</code> class.</p>
<h2 id="filesexists"><a name="user-content-filesexists" href="#filesexists" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.exists()</h2>
<p>The <code>Files.exists()</code> method checks if a given <code>Path</code> exists in the file system.</p>
<p>It is possible to create <code>Path</code> instances that do not exist in the file system. For instance, if you plan to create a new directory, you would first create the corresponding <code>Path</code> instance, and then create the directory.</p>
<p>Since <code>Path</code> instances may or may not point to paths that exist in the file system, you can use the <code>Files.exists()</code> method to determine if they do (in case you need to check that).</p>
<p>Here is a Java <code>Files.exists()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging.properties&quot;);

boolean pathExists =
        Files.exists(path,
            new LinkOption[]{ LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS});
</code></pre>

<p>This example first creates a <code>Path</code> instance pointing to the path we want to check if exists or not. Second, the example calls the <code>Files.exists()</code> method with the <code>Path</code> instance as the first parameter.</p>
<p>Notice the second parameter of the <code>Files.exists()</code> method. This parameter is an array of options that influence how the <code>Files.exists()</code> determines if the path exists or not. In this example above the array contains the <code>LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS</code> which means that the <code>Files.exists()</code> method should not follow symbolic links in the file system to determine if the path exists.</p>
<h2 id="filescreatedirectory"><a name="user-content-filescreatedirectory" href="#filescreatedirectory" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.createDirectory()</h2>
<p>The <code>Files.createDirectory()</code> method creates a new directory from a <code>Path</code> instance. Here is a Java <code>Files.createDirectory()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/subdir&quot;);

try {
    Path newDir = Files.createDirectory(path);
} catch(FileAlreadyExistsException e){
    // the directory already exists.
} catch (IOException e) {
    //something else went wrong
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The first line creates the <code>Path</code> instance that represents the directory to create. Inside the <code>try-catch</code> block the <code>Files.createDirectory()</code> method is called with the path as parameter. If creating the directory succeeds, a <code>Path</code> instance is returned which points to the newly created path.</p>
<p>If the directory already exists, a <code>java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException</code> will be thrown. If something else goes wrong, an <code>IOException</code> may get thrown. For instance, if the parent directory of the desired, new directory does not exist, an <code>IOException</code> may get thrown. The parent directory is the directory in which you want to create the new directory. Thus, it means the parent directory of the new directory.</p>
<h2 id="filescopy"><a name="user-content-filescopy" href="#filescopy" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.copy()</h2>
<p>The <code>Files.copy()</code> method copies a file from one path to another. Here is a Java NIO <code>Files.copy()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path sourcePath      = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging.properties&quot;);
Path destinationPath = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging-copy.properties&quot;);

try {
    Files.copy(sourcePath, destinationPath);
} catch(FileAlreadyExistsException e) {
    //destination file already exists
} catch (IOException e) {
    //something else went wrong
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>First the example creates a source and destination <code>Path</code> instance. Then the example calls <code>Files.copy()</code>, passing the two <code>Path</code> instances as parameters. This will result in the file referenced by the source path to be copied to the file referenced by the destination path.</p>
<p>If the destination file already exists, a <code>java.nio.file.FileAlreadyExistsException</code> is thrown. If something else goes wrong, an <code>IOException</code> will be thrown. For instance, if the directory to copy the file to does not exist, an <code>IOException</code> will be thrown.</p>
<h3 id="overwriting-existing-files"><a name="user-content-overwriting-existing-files" href="#overwriting-existing-files" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Overwriting Existing Files</h3>
<p>It is possible to force the <code>Files.copy()</code> to overwrite an existing file. Here an example showing how to overwrite an existing file using <code>Files.copy()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path sourcePath      = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging.properties&quot;);
Path destinationPath = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging-copy.properties&quot;);

try {
    Files.copy(sourcePath, destinationPath,
            StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
} catch(FileAlreadyExistsException e) {
    //destination file already exists
} catch (IOException e) {
    //something else went wrong
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the third parameter to the <code>Files.copy()</code> method. This parameter instructs the <code>copy()</code> method to overwrite an existing file if the destination file already exists.</p>
<h2 id="filesmove"><a name="user-content-filesmove" href="#filesmove" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.move()</h2>
<p>The Java NIO <code>Files</code> class also contains a function for moving files from one path to another. Moving a file is the same as renaming it, except moving a file can both move it to a different directory and change its name in the same operation. Yes, the <code>java.io.File</code> class could also do that with its <code>renameTo()</code> method, but now you have the file move functionality in the <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> class too.</p>
<p>Here is a Java <code>Files.move()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path sourcePath      = Paths.get(&quot;data/logging-copy.properties&quot;);
Path destinationPath = Paths.get(&quot;data/subdir/logging-moved.properties&quot;);

try {
    Files.move(sourcePath, destinationPath,
            StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
} catch (IOException e) {
    //moving file failed.
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>First the source path and destination path are created. The source path points to the file to move, and the destination path points to where the file should be moved to. Then the <code>Files.move()</code> method is called. This results in the file being moved.</p>
<p>Notice the third parameter passed to <code>Files.move()</code> . This parameter tells the <code>Files.move()</code> method to overwrite any existing file at the destination path. This parameter is actually optional.</p>
<p>The <code>Files.move()</code> method may throw an <code>IOException</code> if moving the file fails. For instance, if a file already exists at the destination path, and you have left out the <code>StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING</code> option, or if the file to move does not exist etc.</p>
<h2 id="filesdelete"><a name="user-content-filesdelete" href="#filesdelete" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.delete()</h2>
<p>The <code>Files.delete()</code> method can delete a file or directory. Here is a Java <code>Files.delete()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/subdir/logging-moved.properties&quot;);

try {
    Files.delete(path);
} catch (IOException e) {
    //deleting file failed
    e.printStackTrace();
}
</code></pre>

<p>First the <code>Path</code> pointing to the file to delete is created. Second the <code>Files.delete()</code> method is called. If the <code>Files.delete()</code> fails to delete the file for some reason (e.g. the file or directory does not exist), an <code>IOException</code> is thrown.</p>
<h2 id="fileswalkfiletree"><a name="user-content-fileswalkfiletree" href="#fileswalkfiletree" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Files.walkFileTree()</h2>
<p>The <code>Files.walkFileTree()</code> method contains functionality for traversing a directory tree recursively. The <code>walkFileTree()</code> method takes a <code>Path</code> instance and a <code>FileVisitor</code> as parameters. The <code>Path</code> instance points to the directory you want to traverse. The <code>FileVisitor</code> is called during traversion.</p>
<p>Before I explain how the traversal works, here is first the <code>FileVisitor</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="java">public interface FileVisitor {

    public FileVisitResult preVisitDirectory(
        Path dir, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException;

    public FileVisitResult visitFile(
        Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException;

    public FileVisitResult visitFileFailed(
        Path file, IOException exc) throws IOException;

    public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(
        Path dir, IOException exc) throws IOException {

}
</code></pre>

<p>You have to implement the <code>FileVisitor</code> interface yourself, and pass an instance of your implementation to the <code>walkFileTree()</code> method. Each method of your <code>FileVisitor</code> implementation will get called at different times during the directory traversal. If you do not need to hook into all of these methods, you can extend the <code>SimpleFileVisitor</code> class, which contains default implementations of all methods in the <code>FileVisitor</code> interface.</p>
<p>Here is a <code>walkFileTree()</code> example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Files.walkFileTree(path, new FileVisitor&lt;Path&gt;() {
  @Override
  public FileVisitResult preVisitDirectory(Path dir, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(&quot;pre visit dir:&quot; + dir);
    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
  }

  @Override
  public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(&quot;visit file: &quot; + file);
    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
  }

  @Override
  public FileVisitResult visitFileFailed(Path file, IOException exc) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(&quot;visit file failed: &quot; + file);
    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
  }

  @Override
  public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(Path dir, IOException exc) throws IOException {
    System.out.println(&quot;post visit directory: &quot; + dir);
    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Each of the methods in the <code>FileVisitor</code> implementation gets called at different times during traversal:</p>
<p>The <code>preVisitDirectory()</code> method is called just before visiting any directory. The <code>postVisitDirectory()</code> method is called just after visiting a directory.</p>
<p>The <code>visitFile()</code> mehtod is called for every file visited during the file walk. It is not called for directories - only files. The <code>visitFileFailed()</code> method is called in case visiting a file fails. For instance, if you do not have the right permissions, or something else goes wrong.</p>
<p>Each of the four methods return a <code>FileVisitResult</code> enum instance. The <code>FileVisitResult</code> enum contains the following four options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONTINUE</code></li>
<li><code>TERMINATE</code></li>
<li><code>SKIP_SIBLINGS</code></li>
<li><code>SKIP_SUBTREE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By returning one of these values the called method can decide how the file walk should continue.</p>
<p><code>CONTINUE</code> means that the file walk should continue as normal.</p>
<p><code>TERMINATE</code> means that the file walk should terminate now.</p>
<p><code>SKIP_SIBLINGS</code> means that the file walk should continue but without visiting any siblings of this file or directory.</p>
<p><code>SKIP_SUBTREE</code> means that the file walk should continue but without visiting the entries in this directory. This value only has a function if returned from <code>preVisitDirectory()</code>. If returned from any other methods it will be interpreted as a <code>CONTINUE</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Files.walkFileTree()</code> can also be used to delete a directory with all files and subdirectories inside it. The <code>Files.delete()</code> method will only delete a directory if it is empty. By walking through all directories and deleting all files (inside <code>visitFile()</code>) in each directory, and afterwards delete the directory itself (inside <code>postVisitDirectory()</code>) you can delete a directory with all subdirectories and files. Here is a recursive directory deletion example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path rootPath = Paths.get(&quot;data/to-delete&quot;);

try {
  Files.walkFileTree(rootPath, new SimpleFileVisitor&lt;Path&gt;() {
    @Override
    public FileVisitResult visitFile(Path file, BasicFileAttributes attrs) throws IOException {
      System.out.println(&quot;delete file: &quot; + file.toString());
      Files.delete(file);
      return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
    }

    @Override
    public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory(Path dir, IOException exc) throws IOException {
      Files.delete(dir);
      System.out.println(&quot;delete dir: &quot; + dir.toString());
      return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;
    }
  });
} catch(IOException e){
  e.printStackTrace();

<p>The <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> class contains many other useful functions, like functions for creating symbolic links, determining the file size, setting file permissions etc. Check out the JavaDoc for the <code>java.nio.file.Files</code> class for more information about these methods.</p>

<p>In Java 7 the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> was added to Java NIO. The <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> makes it possible to read data from, and write data to files asynchronously. This tutorial will explain how to use the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-asynchronousfilechannel"><a name="user-content-creating-an-asynchronousfilechannel" href="#creating-an-asynchronousfilechannel" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Creating an AsynchronousFileChannel</h2>
<p>You create an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> via its static method <code>open()</code>. Here is an example of creating an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/test.xml&quot;);

AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel =
    AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.READ);
</code></pre>

<p>The first parameter to the <code>open()</code> method is a <a href="path.html">Path</a> instance pointing to the file the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is to be associated with.</p>
<p>The second parameter is one or more open options which tell the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> what operations is to be performed on the underlying file. In this example we used the <code>StandardOpenOption.READ</code> which means that the file will be opened for reading.</p>
<h2 id="reading-data"><a name="user-content-reading-data" href="#reading-data" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Data</h2>
<p>You can read data from an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> in two ways. Each way to read data call one of the <code>read()</code> methods of the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code>. Both methods of reading data will be covered in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="reading-data-via-a-future"><a name="user-content-reading-data-via-a-future" href="#reading-data-via-a-future" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Data Via a Future</h2>
<p>The first way to read data from an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is to call the <code>read()</code> method that returns a <code>Future</code>. Here is how calling that <code>read()</code> method looks:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Future&lt;Integer&gt; operation = fileChannel.read(buffer, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>This version of the <code>read()</code> method takes <code>ByteBuffer</code> as first parameter. The data read from the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is read into this <code>ByteBuffer</code>. The second parameter is the byte position in the file to start reading from.</p>
<p>The <code>read()</code> method return immediately, even if the read operation has not finished. You can check the when the read operation is finished by calling the <code>isDone()</code> method of the <code>Future</code> instance returned by the <code>read()</code> method.</p>
<p>Here is a longer example showing how to use this version of the <code>read()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="java">AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel = 
    AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.READ);

ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
long position = 0;

Future&lt;Integer&gt; operation = fileChannel.read(buffer, position);

while(!operation.isDone());

buffer.flip();
byte[] data = new byte[buffer.limit()];
buffer.get(data);
System.out.println(new String(data));
buffer.clear();
</code></pre>

<p>This example creates an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> and then creates a <code>ByteBuffer</code> which is passed to the <code>read()</code> method as parameter, along with a position of 0. After calling <code>read()</code> the example loops until the <code>isDone()</code> method of the returned <code>Future</code> returns true. Of course, this is not a very efficient use of the CPU - but somehow you need to wait until the read operation has completed.</p>
<p>Once the read operation has completed the data read into the <code>ByteBuffer</code> and then into a String and printed to <code>System.out</code> .</p>
<h2 id="reading-data-via-a-completionhandler"><a name="user-content-reading-data-via-a-completionhandler" href="#reading-data-via-a-completionhandler" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Reading Data Via a CompletionHandler</h2>
<p>The second method of reading data from an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is to call the <code>read()</code> method version that takes a <code>CompletionHandler</code> as a parameter. Here is how you call this <code>read()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="java">fileChannel.read(buffer, position, buffer, new CompletionHandler&lt;Integer, ByteBuffer&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void completed(Integer result, ByteBuffer attachment) {
        System.out.println(&quot;result = &quot; + result);

        attachment.flip();
        byte[] data = new byte[attachment.limit()];
        attachment.get(data);
        System.out.println(new String(data));
        attachment.clear();
    }

    @Override
    public void failed(Throwable exc, ByteBuffer attachment) {

    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Once the read operation finishes the <code>CompletionHandler</code>&lsquo;s <code>completed()</code> method will be called. As parameters to the <code>completed()</code> method are passed an <code>Integer</code> telling how many bytes were read, and the &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; which was passed to the <code>read()</code> method. The &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; is the third parameter to the <code>read()</code> method. In this case it was the <code>ByteBuffer</code> into which the data is also read. You can choose freely what object to attach.</p>
<p>If the read operation fails, the <code>failed()</code> method of the <code>CompletionHandler</code> will get called instead.</p>
<h2 id="writing-data"><a name="user-content-writing-data" href="#writing-data" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Data</h2>
<p>Just like with reading, you can write data to an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> in two ways. Each way to write data call one of the <code>write()</code> methods of the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code>. Both methods of writing data will be covered in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="writing-data-via-a-future"><a name="user-content-writing-data-via-a-future" href="#writing-data-via-a-future" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Data Via a Future</h2>
<p>The <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> also enables you to write data asynchronously. Here is a full Java <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> write example:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/test-write.txt&quot;);
AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel = 
    AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.WRITE);

ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
long position = 0;

buffer.put(&quot;test data&quot;.getBytes());
buffer.flip();

Future&lt;Integer&gt; operation = fileChannel.write(buffer, position);
buffer.clear();

while(!operation.isDone());

System.out.println(&quot;Write done&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>First an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is opened in write mode. Then a <code>ByteBuffer</code> is created and some data written into it. Then the data in the <code>ByteBuffer</code> is written to the file. Finally the example checks the returned <code>Future</code> to see when the write operation has completed.</p>
<p>Note, that the file must already exist before this code will work. If the file does not exist the <code>write()</code> method will throw a <code>java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException</code> .</p>
<p>You can make sure that the file the <code>Path</code> points to exists with the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="java">if(!Files.exists(path)){
    Files.createFile(path);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="writing-data-via-a-completionhandler"><a name="user-content-writing-data-via-a-completionhandler" href="#writing-data-via-a-completionhandler" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Writing Data Via a CompletionHandler</h2>
<p>You can also write data to the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> with a <code>CompletionHandler</code> to tell you when the write is complete instead of a <code>Future</code>. Here is an example of writing data to the <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> with a <code>CompletionHandler</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Path path = Paths.get(&quot;data/test-write.txt&quot;);
if(!Files.exists(path)){
    Files.createFile(path);
}
AsynchronousFileChannel fileChannel = 
    AsynchronousFileChannel.open(path, StandardOpenOption.WRITE);

ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
long position = 0;

buffer.put(&quot;test data&quot;.getBytes());
buffer.flip();

fileChannel.write(buffer, position, buffer, new CompletionHandler&lt;Integer, ByteBuffer&gt;() {

    @Override
    public void completed(Integer result, ByteBuffer attachment) {
        System.out.println(&quot;bytes written: &quot; + result);
    }

    @Override
    public void failed(Throwable exc, ByteBuffer attachment) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Write failed&quot;);
        exc.printStackTrace();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CompletionHandler</code>&lsquo;s <code>completed()</code> method will get called when the write operation completes. If the write fails for some reason, the <code>failed()</code> method will get called instead.</p>
<p>Notice how the <code>ByteBuffer</code> is used as attachment - the object which is passed on to the <code>CompletionHandler</code>&lsquo;s methods.</p></article></body></html>
